# Android_project
software project for class CMSC-355 (Fall 2015)

--- The app is called FreeTime which would manage meetups with friends. At its core, the app is just Boolean variable that says if you’re free or not, and if everyone in a group is free, it sends a notification. The app could also be easily expanded to have multiple groups, messaging, event planning, Google calendar support, meetups, GPS integration, automated free times.
